# typanzee
a local desktop program in c# designed to work like monkeytype

### current functionality:
 - typing
 - wpm counter
 - timer
 - restarting tests
 - different test lengths
 - time and words testing modes
 - save scores locally

### planned functionality:
 - more test types (zen, custom, multiplayer?)
 - custom themes
 - custom fonts
 - probably more stuff, i eventually would like it to have most of the same functionality as monkeytype

### stuff i really want to do but probably cant
 - implement integration with monkeytype:
      this could include validating and uploading scores, future integration with tribes (multiplayer) and more.
      not only is this stuff super low priority, i also would have to get miodec on board and i dunno about that

## FAQ:

#### why?
one day i wondered if you could use monkeytype offline, and found out that you couldn't. so, I wrote this.

#### can I use it?
download the release and run the .exe

#### can I steal your code?
yeah

#### can I steal the name/branding?
no

#### can I help?
not right now, its not a big enough project to warrant multiple people working on it. maybe in the future though.
